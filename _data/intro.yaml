  _“I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing.”_


  Some call me the Dude, others Ben. However you address me, I'm a veteran copywriter & stringer hailing from Southern California with nearly a decade of combined experience crafting cutting-edge, insightful and entertaining content for commercial clients of all sizes. My diverse portfolio includes the likes of Patagonia, Smartshoot, Arc'teryx, LEVEL, Al-Jazeera English and Vice News. Whether it’s written or visual, digital or print, I’ve got your bases covered.
